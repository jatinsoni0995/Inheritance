# Java Inheritance Demo
A Java project demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, and method overriding using an Animal hierarchy.

## Learned Concepts
- Inheritance: Parent-child class hierarchy.
- Polymorphism: Dynamic method dispatch via overridden methods.
- Method Overriding: Customizing parent class behaviors.

## Features
- Parent class `Animal` with generic behaviors.
- Child classes `Dog` and `Fish` with overridden methods.
- Polymorphic behavior via `doAnimalStuff()` method.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaInheritanceDemo.git`
2. Compile: `javac src/Inheritance/*.java`
3. Run: `java Inheritance.Main`
